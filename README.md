# Rogue_AP_Detector
This software is designed to detect rogue access points

In the modern world, with the development of technology and the increasing use of wireless networks, the problem of fake access points is becoming more and more relevant. Fake access points are devices that mimic real wireless networks, but are actually intended to obtain confidential information from users who connect to them.

To protect against fake access points, it is necessary to develop effective methods and ways to detect and prevent connection to them. This presents a serious problem for companies, organizations, and individuals, as the leakage of confidential information can lead to serious consequences.
